<h4 style="margin-top:20px;">Detailed Game Instructions</h4>
<p>In Taboo with Strangers, you will be assigned to either a clue-giving or a clue-guessing role for the first round. At the end of each round, the roles switch. Your goal is to get as many points as possible in the time provided.</p>
<p><strong>As a clue-giver</strong> you will receive a "card" that contains a main word and 5 forbidden words. The goal is to provide clues to help the other player guess your main word without using any of the words in the main word or in the forbidden words. This includes words that are part of a longer phrase, so if your main word is "Dutch paintings" you cannot use the words "Dutch," "paintings," "painting," or "paint." If you do happen to use one of the forbidden words, you have comitted a "taboo" and you will lose a point and receive a new card. Once you are done providing all the clues you think your guesser will need, hit "Send to Guesser" and your turn will end until your guesser responds to your clues. If your guesser guesses correctly, you'll both gain a point and you'll receive a new card to provide clues for.</p> 
<p><strong>As a clue-guesser</strong> you will receive clues from your clue-giver. Your goal is to guess the word or phrase they are describing. You may request that your clue-giver provide more clues or to skip the card with no points penalty if you think your time would be better spent guessing a new word.</p>
